# Calculator

This project is based on an article published on medium.com, by Michael Ozoemena on Apr 14, 2017.

The goal of this project: understand recursion, algorithm, and tests to get more familiar with Js programming.

## Steps to complete any project:
<ol>
  <li>Create a Github for the program.</li>
  <li>Write the program algorithm.</li>
  <li>Code the program according to the algorithm.</li>
  <li>Write tests for the code.</li>
</ol>

## A simple calculator algorithm will look like this:
<ol>
  <li>Get the equation</li>
  <li>Break it down using “()”</li>
  <li>Calculate it</li>
  <li>Return the result</li>
</ol>

To solve this problem will use recursion: repeatedly creating a smaller version of a given situation until the problem is solved. A recursive function calls itself from within itself.

## Javascript built-in function used in this program:
```javascript
  eval()
  split()
  substring()
```
