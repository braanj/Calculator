# Calculator

This project is based on an article published on <a href="https://medium.com/afwican-dev/building-a-calculator-9d05e45d113a">medium.com</a>, by Michael Ozoemena on Apr 14, 2017.

The goal of this project: understand recursion, algorithm, and tests to get more familiar with Js programming.

## Steps to complete any project:
<ol>
  <li>Create a Github for the program.</li>
  <li>Write the program algorithm.</li>
  <li>Code the program according to the algorithm.</li>
  <li>Write tests for the code.</li>
</ol>

## A simple calculator algorithm will look like this:
<ol>
  <li>Get the equation</li>
  <li>Break it down using “()”</li>
  <li>Calculate it</li>
  <li>Return the result</li>
</ol>

To solve this problem will use recursion: repeatedly creating a smaller version of a given situation until the problem is solved. A recursive function calls itself from within itself.

## Languages used in this project:

<ol>
  <li>Html5</li>
  <li>Css3</li>
  <li>Javascript ES6</li>
</ol>

## Javascript built-in function used in this program:
```javascript
  eval()
  split()
  substring()
  includes()
```

## Neends to be built:
<ul>
  <li>A function to add '()' to the equation.
</ul>
